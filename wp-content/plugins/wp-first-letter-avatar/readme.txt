Set custom avatars for users with no Gravatar. The avatar will be the first (or any other) letter of user's name on a colorful background.

== Description ==

WP First Letter Avatar **sets custom avatars for users without Gravatar**. The avatar will be a first letter of the user's name. You can also configure the plugin to use any other letter to set custom avatar.

WP First Letter Avatar includes a set of **beautiful, colorful letter avatars** in many sizes. Optimal size will be chosen by the plugin in order to display high quality avatar and not download, for example, big 512px avatars when only 48px is needed... **PSD template** for avatar is also included.

You can also create your own avatar set by creating new directory next to *'default'* folder and following the naming convention from *'default'*. 

By default, custom avatar will be set only to users without Gravatars, but you can change that in settings and not use Gravatar at all.

WP First Letter Avatar helps you **bring more colors** into your blog. Plus, your readers will be more **willing to comment on your posts**, since they can actually relate to these avatars much better than to Mystery Person.

All images were compressed using the fantastic [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/), so avatars are **incredibly light and ultra-high quality**.

WP First Letter Avatar is also available [on GitHub](https://github.com/Dev49net/wp-first-letter-avatar).

= Compatibility with other plugins =
WP First Letter Avatar is fully compatible with [bbPress](https://bbpress.org/) and [wpDiscuz](http://www.gvectors.com/wpdiscuz/).

= Requirements =
WP First Letter Avatar requires at least PHP 5.4. It **does not work properly** on PHP 5.3.x and earlier.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Plugin does not work, what should I do? =

There may be some conflict with this plugin and some other plugins you are using. If WP First Letter Avatar is overriding your other avatar plugins, please go to plugin settings and change Filter Priority value to a lower value - for example 9, or even -1. If other plugins are overriding WP First Letter Avatar images, try increasing the value to 11 or 9999. Experimenting with these values should give you some results. Filter priority value basically specifies the order that avatar filters are executed in. Setting it to a high value will cause WP First Letter Avatar to execute after other plugins, whereas setting it to a low value will execute WP First Letter Avatar before other plugins.

= Can I change custom avatars? =

Absolutely! Just create new directory in 'images' directory, call it, for example 'my_avatar_set' and change the avatar set in settings. Make sure to follow the directory and filename convention. 
NOTE: Your custom avatars WILL BE DELETED after updating the plugin! Make backup! 

= Can I set custom avatars based on last (or any other) character in user's name? =
Of course! This can be done in plugin settings.

= I don't want to use Gravatar at all. Can I disable it? =
Yes! By default, WP First Letter Avatar sets custom avatar only to users without Gravatar, but in plugin settings you can disable it and use custom avatar for everybody.

= Is WP First Letter Avatar compatible with other plugins? =
WP First Letter Avatar has fully tested compatibilty with bbPress and wpDiscuz. For BuddyPress compatibility, please use my other plugin - [BuddyPress First Letter Avatar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress-first-letter-avatar/).

= Can avatars be round, like in Google+? =
Yes - just go to plugin settings and click Round avatars.
