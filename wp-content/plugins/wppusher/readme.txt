= Get started =

If you already use Git for your projects and your themes and plugins are in their own repositories on GitHub, getting started with WP Pusher is simple and easy. Just go to "New plugin" or "New theme" in the WP Pusher menu and type in the repository for the package: github-username/repository-name

If any of your plugins or themes are in private repositories on GitHub, WP Pusher will need a token to access them. You can read GitHub's guide to application tokens [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/). Paste in the token at WP Pusher settings page.

= Conventions =

* Theme stylesheets _must_ be named the same as the repository
* Plugin directories _must_ be named the same as the repository
* GitHub version tags _must_ be numeric, such as '1.0' or '1.0.1', with an optional preceding 'v', such as 'v1.0.1'
* WordPress version tags _must_ be numeric, such as '1.0' or '1.0.1'

= Git workflow =

The way WP Pusher works, packages (themes and plugins) need to be in their own repositories. If your packages are in their own repositories already, you can safely skip this section. Some developers prefer having their whole WordPress installation under Git, which potentially makes things a bit more complicated. By having all packages in their own repositories, you can easily share code across clients / projects. Since you shouldn’t be editing the core WordPress code, in most cases having the whole project under Git shouldn’t be necessary. However, if for some reason your project require that you have one Git repository for the whole project, you will have to use Git submodules, so that you can still have every package in its own (sub) repository.

== Changelog ==

= 2.4.3 =

* Always add trailing slashes to Push-to-Deploy URLs, to prevent redirects (that GitHub and Bitbucket won't follow). This should not be a breaking change, since 1. root level URLs (wppusher.com) are the same with or without trailing slashes (.com vs .com/) and 2. WordPress always add a trailing slash to a site in a subdirectory (wppusher.com/blog/).
