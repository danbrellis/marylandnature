= How do I get the image for a term? =

With WordPress's `get_term_meta()` function

`
// image id is stored as term meta
$image_id = get_term_meta( 7, 'image', true );

// image data stored in array, second argument is which image size to retrieve
$image_data = wp_get_attachment_image_src( $image_id, 'full' );

// image url is the first item in the array (aka 0)
$image = $image_data[0];

if ( ! empty( $image ) ) {
    echo '<img src="' . esc_url( $image ) . '" />';
}
`
