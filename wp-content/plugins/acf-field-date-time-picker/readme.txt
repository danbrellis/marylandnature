= Updating to ACF PRO =

I got this quetion over at [AWP on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/permalink/1198240376904841/?comment_id=1198432300218982&notif_t=group_comment&notif_id=1469033404164280):

`
How does upgrading work? If someone starts with ACF and your plugin,
then upgrades to ACF Pro, will their date/time custom field disappear?
I understand the data will be maintained but wondering if the field
will still be visible in WP admin.
`

Updating to ACF PRO should work fine, ACF PRO has a compatibility add-on for this plugin, but test it on a non production environment first.

Also, read the comments on this issue: [https://github.com/.../acf-field-date-time-picker/issues/103](https://github.com/.../acf-field-date-time-picker/issues/103)


= How do I set the date and time format? =

To set  the date and time format when you create the field, you have to create a string using the letters below.

= Date format =

`
d    day of month (no leading zero)
dd   day of month (two digit)
o    day of the year (no leading zeros)
oo   day of the year (three digit)
D    day name short
DD   day name long
m    month of year (no leading zero)
mm   month of year (two digit)
M    month name short
MM   month name long
y    year (two digit)
yy   year (four digit)
`

= Time format =

`
H    Hour with no leading 0 (24 hour)
HH   Hour with leading 0 (24 hour)
h    Hour with no leading 0 (12 hour)
hh   Hour with leading 0 (12 hour)
m    Minute with no leading 0
mm   Minute with leading 0
s    Second with no leading 0
ss   Second with leading 0
l    Milliseconds always with leading 0
t    a or p for AM/PM
T    A or P for AM/PM
tt   am or pm for AM/PM
TT   AM or PM for AM/PM
`


= Examples =

* `yy-mm-dd`: 2013-04-12
* `HH:mm`: 24 hour clock, with a leading 0 for hour and minute
* `h:m tt`: 12 hour clock with am/pm, no leading 0

**How do I format the date and time when I want to use it in my theme?**

The Date and Time Picker field is saved as an UNIX timestamp. Use the PHP [date](http://php.net/manual/en/function.date.php) function when you use it in your theme.
